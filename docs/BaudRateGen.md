# Baud Rate Generator

A baud rate generator is a form of digital clock divider which generates a
target transmitter and receiver clock rate based on the input clock,
desired baudrate, and desired oversample.

## Functionality

### Basics

The `rate` input represents the period of the `txClk`. Put another way, it's a
simple counter that sets the `txClk` to `[~phase]` every `[rate]` clock ticks.

The `rxClk` will have `[Oversample]` number of `[~phase]` edges every `txClk`
period. The period of the `rxClk` is referred to as the `rxRate`. These edges
will be evenly spaced within the `txClk` period, with the goal of the
`[Oversample / 2]`<sup>th</sup> edge being directly in the center of the
`txClk` period.

This is achieved with two "wait" zones, the `preWait` zone and the `postWait`
zone, which account for the indivisble remainder of the `rate` divided by the
`Oversample`. Each wait zone is about half of the remainder.

Additionally, the `rxClk` is shifted a half-period (ie, `rxRate / 2`) left
within the overall `txClk` period, to further center the sampling. This shift is
referred to as the `offset` within the rate calculations.
